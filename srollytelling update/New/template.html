        <p>In 2015, the city of Boston launched its <a href = "https://www.cityofboston.gov/311/">311 service</a>, previously the Mayor’s hotline, to make it easier for residents to report non-emergency issues and access city services.  “If you have a broken street lamp, missed trash pickup, graffiti on your building, a bigfoot sighting or anything else that concerns you, use the new system,” Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said in a video where he introduced Boston 311 services.</p>
        <p  id="trigger1" >Boston 311 services are not only accessible by phone calls; constituents can connect to the service online and through an app. People call 311 most often to report a pothole, get a street cleaned, pay a parking ticket or request a needle clean-up. In Boston specifically, where winter is harsh, 311 also receives winter service requests like: report unshoveled sidewalk, request to salt or plow a street or help with insufficient home heating.</p>

        <h2 id="trigger2">Number of Calls by Neighborhoods</h2>

        <p >Since its opening, residents in Boston have increasingly taken advantage of the 311 service.</p>
        <p>From 2012 to 2018, the use of 311 non-emergency calls is increased by 10 percent. That is likely because more constituents get knowledge of and use 311 non-emergency calls than before.</p>
        <p >However, some neighborhoods report more incidents to 311 than others (then the map appears)
        Overall, the majority of the calls come from the eastern neighborhoods, such as Dorchester, South Boston, and Roxbury. Both in 2012 and 2018, the largest number of calls come from Dorchester, which is also increased by 4.2 percent over that time.</p>
        <p>Although Dorchester (maybe make the Dorchester area blink and when the mouse hover on it, there is a tooltip with the number of calls) is where the most calls came from both in seven consecutive years, the Fenway area saw the biggest increase in calls during the same time. (maybe emphasize Fenway on the map?)</p>
        <p >However, Dorchester is not the community that saw calls increased the most. The Fenway area increased by nearly 80 percent from 2012 to 2018. The numbers of calls in Brighton are the lowest both for the two years. In 2012, Dorchester had nearly 60 times as many calls as Brighton.</p>

        <p id="trigger3">There is a huge difference between the use of 311 non-emergency calls in the most popular neighborhood Dorchester and the most underused area Chestnut Hill.</p>
        <p>Another interesting thing is that there are 23 neighborhoods in the City of Boston, but there are only 18 neighborhoods has recorded. There are no records for North End, West End, Bay Village, and Chinatown, and Mid Dorchester.</p>

        <h2>Popular Reasons for 311 Calls</h2>

        <p>The reasons people call is another aspect we will look at. We will compare the reasons people call in 2012 with the reasons people call in 2018.</p>
        <p>According to the data, there are 39 reasons for the calls in 2012,  and in 2018, there are 46 reasons. Ten more reasons are added and three reasons were removed.</p>
        <p>Among those 10 added categories, <a href = "https://www.masslive.com/news/2018/02/opioid_overdose_deaths_show_crisis_continues_for_massachusetts.html"> “Needle Program”</a>  and <a href = "https://www.boston.gov/departments/animal-care-and-control"> “Animal Issues” </a> were two of the more popular, taking home 1.7 percent and 1.1 percent total.</p>

        <p>Needle exchange programs allow drug users to trade in used needles for clean ones at specific sites, and are used to prevent the spread of disease or infection. The programs have existed in Boston and neighboring Cambridge since 1993, yet was only recently added as a category. The addition of this category to 311 data coincides with the rapidly increasing opioid drug problem the state, and particularly the city, is experiencing.</p>

        <p>The needle exchange were only reported to 311 <a href = "https://www.boston.gov/departments/recovery-services/">from 2015</a></p>

        <p>Though the number of opioid overdose deaths in Boston remained similar from 2016 to 2017 - 196 to 193 - the number of calls received about the exchange program have skyrocketed over time. In 2015, the first year when the the Needle Program was logged as a reason for 311 calls, there were 297 calls. The number then rose to 1,043 calls in 2016, nearly four times as many... That jumped to 1,780 the following year, and 2,276 in 2018. This may have to do with an increased awareness about opioid addiction and reduced stigma surrounding it.</p>

        <p>From 2012 to 2018, the sum of reasons for the call increased to 131,895, which is 11.6 percent. The most popular reason for the call in 2012  was “sanitation”, which constitutes 23 percent of the calls. In 2018, that dropped down to the fourth cited reason.  The second popular reason in 2012 is “highway maintenance”, and that dropped down to the third most popular reason in 2018.</p>

        <div class="sticky-container">
          <section class="sticky-content" id="trigger4">
        <p>“Enforcement and abandoned vehicles” is the most popular call in 2018, which is 17 percent, and it increased by 15 percent from 2012. Next was “street cleaning,” which is 14 percent and it was increased by 5.5 percent. “Code enforcement” increased tremendously, from 0.01 percent in 2012 to 11.4 percent in 2018. (which neighborhoods most significant TK, we think that it’s probably the college neighborhoods like Brighton, Mission Hill, etc.) In 2018, there was a code violation call nearly every day. The spike happened in 2016, when the city went from 331 calls to 9,433 in just a year. That’s the same year that several pieces of legislation were passed to prevent overcrowding in apartments that housed undergraduate students. Though violations had been committed by landlords for years, they previously went unpunished, according to a 2016 Boston Globe story.</p>

        <p>In 2012, few items aside from sanitation, highway maintenance, street lights and street cleaning demanded a high number of calls.  In 2012, there were 14 reasons for over 1000 calls, and 12 of them are under 10 percent, and 7 of them are under 5 percent. The sum of the calls for the other reasons is 4326, which is only 3.7 percent.</p>

        <p>In 2018, there are 17 topics with over 1000 calls. Five of them are over 10 percent and 11 of them are under 4 percent. There are 29 reasons with less than 1000 calls and the sum of the calls for all these reasons is 4268, which is 3 percent.</p>

        <h2>How Fast Requests are Solved in Neighborhoods</h2>

        <p>In Jamaica Plain, the percentage of 311 requests that were not solved on time more-than doubled from 14 to 30 percent from 2011 and 2018, despite the number of total requests remaining consistent. Comparatively,(TK  other neighborhoods with similar problems)</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the percentage of 311 requests that weren’t solved on time dropped significantly in both Back Bay and the financial district, two of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city.</p>

        <p>One interesting outlier is the Fenway neighborhood. In 2011, that neighborhood did not contribute much to the overall number of 311 complaints - just 2,363 -  and comparatively only had about 11 percent of its requests solved later than the projected completion date. That made it on of the most efficient neighborhoods in the city, along with Hyde Park, which also was only overdue for just 11 percent of calls, and West Roxbury.</p>
