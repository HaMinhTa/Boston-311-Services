        <h4>By Josh Sullivan, Ha Ta, Yuan Tian, Mengjiao Yu.</h4>
        <p class="intrograph">What would you do if an abandoned mattress was left in the middle of the sidewalk, blocking anyone in a wheelchair from going down the street? What about if there was a rat infestation in your Allston neighborhood or a hypodermic needle behind the post office? A solution to your problem might be just a tweet away.</p>
        <p class="intrograph">In 2015, the city of Boston launched its <a href="https://www.cityofboston.gov/311/">311 service</a>, previously the Mayor’s hotline, to make it easier for residents to report non-emergency issues and access city services.  “If you have a broken street lamp, missed trash pickup, graffiti on your building, a bigfoot sighting or anything else that concerns you, use the new system,” Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said in a video where he introduced Boston 311 services.</p>
        <p class="intrograph">Boston 311 services are not only accessible by phone calls; constituents can connect to the service online and through an app. People call 311 most often to report a pothole, get a street cleaned, pay a parking ticket or request a needle clean-up. In Boston specifically, where winter is harsh, 311 also receives winter service requests like: report unshoveled sidewalk, request to salt or plow a street or help with insufficient home heating.</p>

        <h2 id="triggerBarChart2012">Number of Calls by Neighborhoods</h2>
        <p>But where do the calls come from the most within Boston’s 23 neighborhoods? As it turns out, the answer, in short, is Dorchester, but the details provide much more insight than just that.</p>
        <p id="triggerBarChart2018">Allston, with a population of nearly 20,000, had the highest calls per capita ratio, with more than one call for every other resident. Yet its next door neighbor Brighton is responsible for the least amount of calls in the city. The two neighborhoods are interchangeable, and filled with college students and recent graduates. Research into things like this can make ways for further improvements to the service if necessary.</p>

        <p>From 2012 to 2018, the use of 311 non-emergency calls is increased by 10 percent. That is likely because more constituents get knowledge of and use 311 non-emergency calls than before.</p>
        <p id="triggerLineChart">No three years saw more variation in the call volume than 2014-2016, as there was an 850,000 call drop off between 2015 and 2016. That, according to Boston 311 Director Rocco Corigliano, is because of an uncharacteristic winter in 2015 in which there seemed to be “a two foot snow storm every week.”</p>
        <p>“That’s sort of like an anomaly, what we have before and after is what we typically have,” Corigliano said. “We reached over 110,000 calls in just February. Take that year out, and that’s pretty much the average.</p>

        <h2 id="triggerPieChart">Popular Reasons for 311 Calls</h2>
        <p>There are a number of ways a Bostonian can report a problem to 311. One of the least utilized methods is through Twitter, but a look at recent data from the social media site offers some context into who is reporting problems to the city.</p>
        <p>Harry Grillo - who otherwise goes by the Twitter name @RedBassett - tweeted at the Boston 311 Twitter account 89 times in 2018. By day, he runs a video lighting company, but in his spare time, he acts as a public transit activist and constantly advocates for bicyclist safety in the city.</p>

        <p>Among those 10 added categories, <a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2018/02/opioid_overdose_deaths_show_crisis_continues_for_massachusetts.html"> “Needle Program”</a>  and <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/animal-care-and-control"> “Animal Issues” </a> were two of the more popular, taking home 1.7 percent and 1.1 percent total.</p>
        <p id="triggerBubbleChart">Needle exchange programs allow drug users to trade in used needles for clean ones at specific sites, and are used to prevent the spread of disease or infection. The programs have existed in Boston and neighboring Cambridge since 1993, yet was only recently added as a category. The addition of this category to 311 data coincides with the rapidly increasing opioid drug problem the state, and particularly the city, is experiencing.</p>
        <p>The needle exchange were only reported to 311 <a href = "https://www.boston.gov/departments/recovery-services/">from 2015</a>.</p>
        <p id="triggerBubbleChartYear">Though the number of opioid overdose deaths in Boston remained similar from 2016 to 2017 - 196 to 193 - the number of calls received about the exchange program have skyrocketed over time. In 2015, the first year when the the Needle Program was logged as a reason for 311 calls, there were 297 calls. The number then rose to 1,043 calls in 2016, nearly four times as many... That jumped to 1,780 the following year, and 2,276 in 2018. This may have to do with an increased awareness about opioid addiction and reduced stigma surrounding it.</p>
        <p id="triggerBubbleChartType">From 2012 to 2018, the sum of reasons for the call increased to 131,895, which is 11.6 percent. The most popular reason for the call in 2012  was “sanitation”, which constitutes 23 percent of the calls. In 2018, that dropped down to the fourth cited reason. The second popular reason in 2012 is “highway maintenance”, and that dropped down to the third most popular reason in 2018.</p>

        <p>“Enforcement and abandoned vehicles” is the most popular call in 2018, which is 17 percent, and it increased by 15 percent from 2012. Next was “street cleaning,” which is 14 percent and it was increased by 5.5 percent. “Code enforcement” increased tremendously, from 0.01 percent in 2012 to 11.4 percent in 2018. (which neighborhoods most significant TK, we think that it’s probably the college neighborhoods like Brighton, Mission Hill, etc.) In 2018, there was a code violation call nearly every day. The spike happened in 2016, when the city went from 331 calls to 9,433 in just a year. That’s the same year that several pieces of legislation were passed to prevent overcrowding in apartments that housed undergraduate students. Though violations had been committed by landlords for years, they previously went unpunished, according to a 2016 Boston Globe story.</p>
        <p>In 2012, few items aside from sanitation, highway maintenance, street lights and street cleaning demanded a high number of calls.  In 2012, there were 14 reasons for over 1000 calls, and 12 of them are under 10 percent, and 7 of them are under 5 percent. The sum of the calls for the other reasons is 4326, which is only 3.7 percent.</p>
        <p>In 2018, there are 17 topics with over 1000 calls. Five of them are over 10 percent and 11 of them are under 4 percent. There are 29 reasons with less than 1000 calls and the sum of the calls for all these reasons is 4268, which is 3 percent.</p>

        <h2>How Fast Requests are Solved in Neighborhoods</h2>
        <p>In Jamaica Plain, the percentage of 311 requests that were not solved on time more-than doubled from 14 to 30 percent from 2011 and 2018, despite the number of total requests remaining consistent. Comparatively,(TK  other neighborhoods with similar problems)</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the percentage of 311 requests that weren’t solved on time dropped significantly in both Back Bay and the financial district, two of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city.</p>
        <p>One interesting outlier is the Fenway neighborhood. In 2011, that neighborhood did not contribute much to the overall number of 311 complaints - just 2,363 -  and comparatively only had about 11 percent of its requests solved later than the projected completion date. That made it on of the most efficient neighborhoods in the city, along with Hyde Park, which also was only overdue for just 11 percent of calls, and West Roxbury.</p>
